**(Hook)**
According to the 2023 CrowdStrike Global Threat Report, a staggering 80% of cyber breaches now leverage identity-based attacks. With Active Directory serving as the identity backbone for over 90% of the Fortune 1000, it has become the adversary's primary target.
This reality is why I built ADversary: an AI-powered cyber range for generating hyper-realistic Active Directory threat simulations.

ADversary is not a static training module. It‚Äôs a dynamic, interactive environment that leverages the state-of-the-art **Google Gemini** AI to craft unique, context-aware attack chains grounded in a user-defined network. This "source-of-truth" methodology eliminates AI hallucinations and ensures every simulation is a direct, plausible reflection of a real-world environment.

Key Features:
üõ°Ô∏è **Gemini-Powered AI Simulation:** Utilizes Google Gemini's advanced capabilities to generate unique attack narratives, adversary commands, and defensive recommendations with high fidelity.

üìù **Grounded-Truth Scenario Generation:** Define your entire AD environment in a structured YAML format, forcing the AI to build its attack based on your reality, not its own assumptions.

üåê **Live Attack Visualization:** Watch the attack unfold on a dynamic network graph that visualizes compromised hosts and the adversary's path in real-time, providing immediate situational awareness.

üìú **Forensic PowerShell Event Logging:** Generates detailed Script Block logs (Event ID 4104) for every command, providing a defender's view for deep forensic analysis and incident response training.

üìä **Automated MITRE ATT&CK¬Æ Mapping:** Every adversary action is automatically mapped to the corresponding MITRE ATT&CK¬Æ tactics and techniques, providing deep context and links to official documentation.

**Tech Stack:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Google Gemini API

This project was a deep dive into the intersection of AI, cybersecurity, and front-end engineering, with the goal of building a tool that is not only technically sophisticated but genuinely useful for both red and blue team training.

I'd love to hear your thoughts. What complex AD scenarios would you want to simulate?

## 2. LinkedIn Project Description

**Project Title:** ADversary: AI-Powered Active Directory Threat Simulation

**Description:**
In an era where identity is the new perimeter, Active Directory has become the primary target for adversaries. ADversary is a professional-grade, AI-powered cyber range I developed to tackle this challenge head-on by generating dynamic, high-fidelity AD attack scenarios using the Google Gemini API.
The platform's core innovation is its "grounded-truth" AI engine, which uses a structured YAML configuration as a strict blueprint, ensuring all generated attack paths are technically accurate and plausible within the user-defined environment.

**Key Achievements & Features:**
*   Architected a highly reliable AI core leveraging the Google Gemini API and its native schema enforcement to generate complex, structured simulation data.
*   Engineered a real-time, data-driven network graph with React/TypeScript that visualizes complex attack paths and compromised assets, providing at-a-glance situational awareness.
*   Integrated a forensic logging system that generates realistic PowerShell Script Block logs (Event ID 4104), providing defenders with critical artifacts for incident analysis and response training.
*   Implemented an automated MITRE ATT&CK¬Æ mapping system that contextualizes every adversary action, linking tactical maneuvers to industry-standard threat intelligence.
*   Developed a high-fidelity "Adversary Event Log" that simulates SIEM telemetry with progressing timestamps and dynamically parsed hostnames for immersive incident response training.

**Technologies Used:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Google Gemini API

## 3. Resume Bullets (For Cybersecurity Roles)

*   Architected and developed ADversary, a dynamic, AI-powered cyber range to simulate sophisticated Active Directory attacks, leveraging Google Gemini to generate hyper-realistic scenarios, network topologies, MITRE ATT&CK¬Æ-mapped adversary actions, and forensic-level PowerShell event logs from user-defined YAML configurations.

*   Implemented a real-time, data-driven interface featuring a dynamic network graph, a realistic "Adversary Event Log," and a PowerShell log viewer to visualize attack paths and security artifacts, enhancing threat analysis capabilities and providing an effective training tool for blue team incident response.

*   Engineered a robust AI service layer for the Google Gemini API, utilizing native response schemas to guarantee the delivery of valid, structured data, ensuring all generated content was strictly grounded in user-provided environmental data to maintain technical accuracy.
