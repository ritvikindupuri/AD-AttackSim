**(Hook)**
Instead of just reading about cyber attacks, what if you could go head-to-head with a live AI adversary?
That's the reality I built with ADversary: a next-generation cyber range where you play as the Blue Team against a reactive, Gemini-powered Red Team agent.

ADversary is not a static training module. It‚Äôs a dynamic, turn-based environment where your defensive actions directly influence the AI's strategy. Block a C2 channel? The AI adapts. Isolate a host? It pivots. This creates a unique, unpredictable, and deeply engaging training experience every single time.

Key Features:
‚öîÔ∏è **Interactive Blue Team vs. AI Red Team:** Go head-to-head with the Gemini agent! Your defensive actions directly influence the AI's next move, creating a unique and unpredictable attack path.

üìù **Grounded-Truth Scenario Generation:** Define your entire AD environment in a structured YAML format, forcing the AI to build its attack based on your reality, not its own assumptions.

üåê **Live Attack Visualization:** Watch the attack unfold on a dynamic network graph that visualizes compromised hosts and the adversary's path in real-time, providing immediate situational awareness.

üìú **Forensic PowerShell Event Logging:** Generates detailed Script Block logs (Event ID 4104) for every command, providing a defender's view for deep forensic analysis and incident response training.

üìä **Automated MITRE ATT&CK¬Æ Mapping:** Every adversary action is automatically mapped to the corresponding MITRE ATT&CK¬Æ tactics and techniques.

**Tech Stack:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Google Gemini API

This project was a deep dive into building stateful, agent-based systems with modern AI. The goal was to create a tool that moves beyond passive learning and genuinely tests a defender's strategic intuition.

I'd love to hear your thoughts. Are interactive AI agents the future of cybersecurity training?

## 2. LinkedIn Project Description

**Project Title:** ADversary: Interactive AI Agent for Active Directory Threat Simulation

**Description:**
ADversary is a professional-grade, AI-powered cyber range I developed that pits security professionals against a reactive AI Red Team agent. Using the Google Gemini API, the platform facilitates a turn-based, "Human vs. AI" simulation where the user's defensive actions dynamically shape the adversary's attack path.
The platform's core innovation is its stateful, agent-based engine, which uses a structured YAML configuration as a strict environmental blueprint, ensuring all generated attack paths are technically accurate and logically responsive to user intervention.

**Key Achievements & Features:**
*   Engineered an interactive, turn-based simulation engine where users act as the Blue Team, making defensive choices that directly influence the Gemini-powered Red Team agent's strategy.
*   Architected a highly reliable, stateful AI service that maintains conversation history with the Gemini API to generate context-aware, reactive attack steps.
*   Designed a real-time, data-driven network graph with React/TypeScript that visualizes complex, evolving attack paths and compromised assets, providing at-a-glance situational awareness.
*   Integrated a forensic logging system that generates realistic PowerShell Script Block logs (Event ID 4104), providing defenders with critical artifacts for incident analysis.

**Technologies Used:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Google Gemini API

## 3. Resume Bullets (For Cybersecurity Roles)

*   Architected and developed ADversary, an interactive, AI-powered cyber range featuring a turn-based "Human vs. AI" simulation where users defend an Active Directory environment against a reactive Red Team agent powered by Google Gemini.

*   Engineered a stateful, conversational AI service that sends user-defined defensive actions and attack history to the Gemini API, enabling the AI to generate dynamic, logically consistent, and unpredictable attack steps in real-time.

*   Implemented a real-time, data-driven interface with a dynamic network graph and forensic log viewers (SIEM & PowerShell Events) to visualize evolving attack paths and security artifacts, providing an advanced training tool for blue team incident response.
